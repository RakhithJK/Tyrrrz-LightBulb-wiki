LightBulb is built using .NET v3.1 Desktop Runtime and requires it to work correctly. The installation process is really simple.

Follow one of the download links below, depending on the bitness of your operating system (i.e. 64-bit or 32-bit):

- [Windows x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.10-windows-x64-installer)
- [Windows x86](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.10-windows-x86-installer)

After downloading, launch the installer to setup the runtime. You don't need to restart your PC after it's done.
