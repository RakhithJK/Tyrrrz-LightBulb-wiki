LightBulb is built using Microsoft's .NET Core 3 runtime and requires it to work correctly. The installation process is really simple.

Follow the directions on the left hand side to download .NET Core runtime for desktop apps. Choose either x64 or x86 depending on your operating system. If in doubt, you can download and install both :)
