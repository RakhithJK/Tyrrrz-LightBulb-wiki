Transition offset allows you to specify how early or late the transitions start, relative to sunrise and sunset. It's best to understand how it works by looking at some examples:

- **0% offset** (default)

  - Day-time transition starts before sunrise and ends at sunrise
  - Night-time transition starts at sunset and ends after sunset

- **25% offset**

  - Day-time transition starts 75% before sunrise and ends 25% after sunrise
  - Night-time transition starts 25% before sunset and ends 75% after sunset

- **50% offset**

  - Day-time transition starts halfway before sunrise and ends halfway after sunrise
  - Night-time transition starts halfway before sunset and ends halfway after sunset

- **75% offset**

  - Day-time transition starts 25% before sunrise and ends 75% after sunrise
  - Night-time transition starts 75% before sunset and ends 25% after sunset

- **100% offset**

  - Day-time transition starts at sunrise and ends after sunrise
  - Night-time transition starts before sunset and ends at sunset

Depending on factors such as window angle, elevation, building density, presence of trees or mountains, etc., adjusting this offset may help bring your monitor's gamma cycle more in line with how the solar cycle is perceived in your environment.
