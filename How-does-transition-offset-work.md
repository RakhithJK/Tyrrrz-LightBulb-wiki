Transition offset allows you to specify how early or late will the transitions start, relative to sunrise and sunset. It's best to understand how it works by looking at its critical values:

- **+100% offset**

  - Day-time transition starts before sunrise and ends at sunrise
  - Night-time transition starts at sunset and ends after sunset

- **0% offset**

  - Day-time transition starts halfway before sunrise and ends halfway after sunrise
  - Night-time transition starts halfway before sunset and ends halfway after sunset

- **-100% offset**

  - Day-time transition starts at sunrise and ends after sunrise
  - Night-time transition starts before sunset and ends at sunset

Depending on different factors, such as window angle, elevation, building density, presence of trees or mountains, etc., you may want to configure this offset to better reflect how the sun is perceived when working on the computer.
