# LightBulb is in maintenance mode

⚠️ This means that, going forward, the project will only receive occasional bug fixes but **no feature updates**. You can still create issues for bug reports, but feature request issues will be declined. Sorry about that.

If you want to carry on with the development of the project, you are welcome to create your own fork.
