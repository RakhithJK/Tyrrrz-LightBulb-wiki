### Cursor is not affected by gamma changes

When hardware cursor rendering is enabled, your mouse pointer is rendered by GPU on a separate layer, thus preventing it from being affected by LightBulb.


### Gamma conflicts with other applications

Some applications may also try to override gamma settings, especially games. In cases where both the application and LightBulb are regularly refreshing gamma, the screen may either flicker or changes by one of the sides may not be seen. Most of the time, you can disable changing gamma in other applications so they don't interfere.
